      <h1>Twlinch Gift Card Terms of Use</h1>

      <h3>Eligibility and Activation:</h3>

      <p>
        The Twlinch Gift Card ("Gift Card") can be redeemed exclusively for
        custom vinyl records or slipmat products available on the Twlinch
        platform. To activate the Gift Card, users must follow the activation
        process provided at the time of purchase, which requires linking the
        Gift Card to a valid email address. The email address used during the
        activation process will be permanently associated with the Gift Card and
        cannot be changed.
      </p>

      <h3>Validity and Expiration:</h3>

      <p>
        The Gift Card is valid for one (1) year from the date of purchase. After
        this period, any remaining balance on the Gift Card will be forfeited
        and cannot be redeemed or refunded. It is the responsibility of the Gift
        Card holder to utilize the balance before the expiration date.
      </p>

      <h3>Redemption:</h3>

      <p>
        The Gift Card may only be redeemed by the person whose email address is
        linked to the card. The balance of the Gift Card can be applied toward
        the purchase of custom vinyl records or slipmat products on the Twlinch
        platform. The Gift Card cannot be used to purchase additional Gift Cards
        or to cover any shipping or handling fees, unless explicitly stated
        otherwise.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-Transferability and Non-Refundability:</h3>

      <p>
        The Gift Card is non-transferable and non-refundable. Once activated, it
        cannot be exchanged for cash, credit, or other forms of currency, except
        where required by law. Twlinch is not responsible for any lost, stolen,
        or unauthorized use of the Gift Card after activation.
      </p>

      <h3>Balance and Usage:</h3>

      <p>
        he balance on the Gift Card can be checked by logging into the Twlinch
        account associated with the activation email. The remaining balance will
        be automatically applied to future purchases until it is depleted or the
        card expires. If a purchase exceeds the balance of the Gift Card, the
        remaining amount must be paid using another valid payment method.
      </p>

      <h3>Fraud Prevention:</h3>

      <p>
        Twlinch reserves the right to deactivate or refuse to honor any Gift
        Card suspected of being obtained fraudulently or in violation of these
        terms.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to Terms:</h3>

      <p>
        Twlinch reserves the right to amend these terms and conditions at any
        time. Any changes will be communicated via the email associated with the
        Gift Card or through the Twlinch website. Continued use of the Gift Card
        after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
      </p>

      <h3>Governing Law:</h3>

      <p>
        These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
        in which Twlinch operates. Any disputes arising from the use of the Gift
        Card shall be resolved in accordance with local law. By activating and
        using the Twlinch Gift Card, you agree to these terms and conditions. If
        you do not agree, please refrain from activating or using the Gift Card
        and contact Twlinch customer support for assistance.
